Later in the afternoon, Lisa arrives, a project manager known for her meticulous organization. She heads straight to her adjustable-height desk, which she keeps meticulously clear. Her only personal items are a sleek, black notebook and a fine-point gel pen, which she uses to quickly jot down meeting notes. Her workhorse is a robust Dell workstation, always running, displaying various project timelines. She also has a small, portable scanner on her desk, which she uses to digitize old paper contracts, a task she’s particularly focused on today.

Meanwhile, David, having finished his meeting with Emily, returns to his corner desk. He picks up his favorite noise-canceling headphones, which he always keeps close by, and puts them on to focus on a challenging coding task. His mechanical keyboard clicks softly as he types. He notices his blue ballpoint pen is missing, perhaps he lent it to Sarah earlier. He makes a mental note to ask her about it.

Over by the kitchenette, Alex is taking a break. He’s just refilled his reusable water bottle, which he keeps next to his ergonomic keyboard at his standing desk. His work laptop, a lightweight Chromebook, is in sleep mode, having been used earlier for a quick video conference. He mostly uses a digital stylus with a large tablet for his graphic design work, but he still likes to sketch ideas on paper with his pencil, a habit he’s had since art school. The office printer, a large, networked device, whirs in the background, churning out a stack of reports for Emily.
